# Code from SwiftLee Articles
Welcome to the code repository for SwiftLee Articles.
This repository contains part of the code examples from articles written at [avanderlee.com](https://www.avanderlee.com).

While I've written articles since 2015, I only started this repository in December 2024. I'll be adding new code examples along the way, so keep an eye on this repository for changes.

## How do you stay current on Swift & SwiftUI?
Swift and SwiftUI are changing rapidly. How do you stay updated?

Let me do the hard work and [subscribe to my free weekly newsletter](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftlee-weekly-subscribe/).

## Exploring code examples
Here's a list of articles and their corresponding code examples.

| [SwiftUI Lists: Present rows of data explained with code examples](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/list-style-selection/) | [SwiftUI/Lists](SwiftUI/Lists)
