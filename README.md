# Code from SwiftLee Articles
Welcome to the code repository for SwiftLee Articles.
This repository contains part of the code examples from articles written at [avanderlee.com](https://www.avanderlee.com).

While I've written articles since 2015, I only started this repository in December 2024. I'll be adding new code examples along the way, so keep an eye on this repository for changes.

## How do you stay current on Swift & SwiftUI?
Swift and SwiftUI are changing rapidly. How do you stay updated?

Let me do the hard work and [subscribe to my free weekly newsletter](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftlee-weekly-subscribe/).

## Exploring code examples
Here's a list of articles and their corresponding code examples.

| Article | Code Examples |
| --- | --- |
| [SwiftUI Button: Custom Styles, Variants, and Best Practices](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/swiftui-button-styles/) | [SwiftUI/Buttons](SwiftUI/Buttons)

### Contributing
I'd love to receive contributions on code examples. Feel free to open a PR if you see improvements or have ideas for additions to my articles.

Thanks,
